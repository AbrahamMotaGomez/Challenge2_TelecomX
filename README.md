Project Description
This project analyzes a telecommunication dataset to understand the factors influencing customer churn. The analysis involves data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to identify key correlations between customer attributes, service usage, and churn behavior.

Dataset

Analysis
The analysis explores the following:

Data loading and initial inspection.
Data normalization to handle nested JSON structures.
Data cleaning and type conversion for relevant columns.
